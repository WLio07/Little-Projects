# Little-Projects
Programs I have developed with my beginner Python knowledge.

encrypter3_2en.py - This program takes an one-paragraph string and converts it  into an unintelligible set of characters. Then, a program will be automatically generated in the Desktop that will have the array of keys to decrypt the code previously created.

threedotscartesianplaneen.py - This program takes the cooordinates of three dots in a cartesian plane and calculates the properties of the geometric figure that was formed.

NumberGuesser.py - This program is a game which will take the chosen min and max of a range and select a random number from it, you have an unlimited amount of tries.

Mediasen.py - This program calculates harmonic, arithmetic, geometric mean, or weighted average.

gradeprobab.py - This program calculates the likelihood of randomly getting x questions right in an exam of y questions of z items each.

PlagiarismDetector.py - This program aims to estimate the likelihood of a set of texts being plagiarized from another given text. It needs the proper weights of its logistic factors in the 'calcula_assinatura(texto)' [calculate_signature(text)] functions. Now that it is translated to english, it will have more features to make it more accurate.

ArticleGenerator.py - The goal of this is to procedurally generate a news article as ready-to-publish as possible — which I’ll use to write the texts of the site I collaborate to.
